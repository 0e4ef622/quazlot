quazlot
=======

Its like quizlet, but in a terminal and super simplified.

* Why "quazlot?"
  * Because I am bad at names

Compile using `clang++` or `g++` and `-std=c++11`.


## Format of cards file
On one line is the word, on the next line is the definition. Empty lines are *not* ignored (I need to fix this).

Example:

    word
    definition
    book
    something you read
    football
    what other people call soccer
    tree
    Earth's lungs
